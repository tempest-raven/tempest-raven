Alle Grundlagen werden in den ersten paar Kämpfen erklärt, lese einfach den Dialog und pass gut auf. Sonny ist ein Kampfspiel mit Runden. Du entscheidest was dein Charakter jede Runde macht, indem du dich zuerst für ein Ziel entscheidest, und dann für eine Fähigkeit die du benutzen willst. Als Beispiel: Du willst einen Gegner angreifen: Klick den Gegner, dann entscheide dich für eine offensive Fähigkeit. Solltest du ein Teammitglied heilen sollen, klick das Mitglied und wähle einen Heileffekt. Du kannst nur 8 Fähigkeit auf deiner Actionbar haben, dieses kannst du im Fähigkeitsmenu konfigurieren.
